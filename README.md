# Sales Tax Calculator

This is a simple application to allow a user to select items to purchase from a list and check out. The user is displayed a summary of the items they purchased, their price including any applicible taxes, as well as the total sales tax and total price of their selections.

## Running the Application
This app is an Angular project. Assuming you have installed the Angular CLI on your machine, the app dependencies can be installed with `npm install`, and can then be run locally using `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view and use the application.

## Notes
Future improvements include:
 - A more thoroughly itemized receipt to provide greater detail.
 - A better system for selecting item quantities, instead of using set amounts.
